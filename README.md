# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier

This project is a Machine Learning based **Spam Email Detector** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple ML classification models.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
This project aims to build a simple and effective spam detector using:

- Preprocesses raw email text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**.
- Trains and evaluates multiple models:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Selects the **best model** based on accuracy and classification metrics.
- Provides detailed evaluation with:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
